# 🧠 Data Science Project: Customer Churn Prediction (BCG X - Forage)

This project simulates a real-world data science task from BCG X, focusing on identifying customer churn drivers and building a predictive model.

## 🔍 Tasks Covered

1. **Business Understanding**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Churn Prediction using Random Forest**
5. **Model Evaluation & Recommendations**

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Classification Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Key Insight

Customers with higher net margins and lower price sensitivity show reduced churn rates. The model helps prioritize high-risk customers for retention.

## 📁 Dataset

Synthetic dataset provided by BCG X (via Forage).
